# MonteCarlo
A quick and simple way to approximate Ï€ using Monte Carlo methods. 
Monte Carlo methods are simply ways to calculate deterministic values from seemingly random data.

In this JupyterNotebook, one is able to mess around with Monte Carlo approximations and visualize what values appear when you divide a circle by a square.

As is shown, the more data points are included, the better the approximation. This is backed up by the following graph which shows how increase the n value leads to a value that is closer to 3.14.
